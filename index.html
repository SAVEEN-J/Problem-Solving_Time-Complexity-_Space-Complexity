    <p> Explain the concept of Big O notation and analyze the time complexity of the linear and binary search algorithms.
        Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the asymptotic behavior of algorithms. It provides a way to characterize the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of how it responds to changes in input size. Big O notation is particularly useful for analyzing time complexity, which measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input.
       
       In Big O notation, the time complexity of an algorithm is expressed using a function of the input size, typically denoted as O(f(n)), where      f(n) is a mathematical function representing the upper bound of the algorithm's time complexity in terms of the input size  n. The function f(n) does not represent the exact time an algorithm takes to execute but rather its growth rate relative to the input size.
       
       
       
        Let's analyze the time complexity of two common search algorithms: linear search and binary search.
       
        Linear Search:
       
        In a linear search, we iterate through each element in the list sequentially until we find the target element or reach the end of the list.

       Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm may have to traverse through all n elements to find the target element, resulting in a linear growth rate of time complexity.
        
       
        Binary Search:
       
        Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm, but it requires the list to be sorted beforehand.
        It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found.
        Time complexity: O(logn), where  n is the number of elements in the list.
        In each step, binary search eliminates half of the remaining elements from consideration, leading to a logarithmic growth rate of time complexity. This makes it significantly faster for large lists compared to linear search.
       
        In summary, the time complexity of linear search is  O(n), indicating a linear relationship between the size of the input and the time taken, while the time complexity of binary search is  O(logn), indicating a logarithmic relationship. This analysis helps in understanding how these algorithms scale with increasing input sizes and enables us to choose the most suitable algorithm for a given problem based on its time complexity requirements.</p>
